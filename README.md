### Ethereum-based lottery

Simple app featuring solidity smart contracts and mocha testing, with thanks to Stephen Grider's excellent course at Udemy.

Lottery app that registers a manager, players, and funds to be contributed and won. MetaMask, the Rinkeby test network, Remix, Infura and Etherscan.

To download and run locally, clone this repo and copy and paste the Lottery.sol into the playground at https://remix.ethereum.org.

You'll need to set up a [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) account and get some (free) test funds from http://faucet.rinkeby.io/.
